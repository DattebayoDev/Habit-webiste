Looking at your test cases overall, what happens if we try to:

Delete a habit at an invalid index (like -1 or 999)?
Delete from an empty habit list?

Would you like to try adding a test for one of these edge cases? Which one interests you most?
Also, when testing array operations, it can be helpful to verify the entire state, not just one element.
How might you verify that all remaining habits are exactly what you expect them to be?



ISSUES
[CRITICAL] Architecture/MVC Violations

Model (HabitManager) contains minimal business logic
Date navigation logic scattered between Model/View: Solved Dec 1
View handles data manipulation that should be in Model: Working 
No Controller to mediate Model-View interaction

[CRITICAL] State Management

Inconsistent state syncing between localStorage and UI
Date state managed in multiple places
No single source of truth for habit completion status

[MODERATE] Error Handling

Missing validation in HabitManager.addHabit()
No error handling for localStorage failures
Checkbox state updates lack error boundaries

[MODERATE] Single Responsibility

View.renderTable handles both rendering and date logic
HabitManager mixes storage and habit management
Date navigation spans multiple responsibilities

[MINOR] Performance

Repeated DOM queries in View constructor
Inefficient table re-rendering on each update
Unnecessary array conversions in header handling
