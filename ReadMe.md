Strategy Pattern

Looking at your test cases overall, what happens if we try to:

Delete a habit at an invalid index (like -1 or 999)?
Delete from an empty habit list?

Would you like to try adding a test for one of these edge cases? Which one interests you most?
Also, when testing array operations, it can be helpful to verify the entire state, not just one element.
How might you verify that all remaining habits are exactly what you expect them to be?



working on 11/27 

[CRITICAL] View class directly manipulates DOM and handles events - violates separation of concerns
[CRITICAL] No error handling for DOM element selection in constructor
[MODERATE] renderCurrentDates uses magic numbers/hardcoded indices
[MODERATE] Checkbox event handler lacks data persistence
[MINOR] No performance optimization for repeated DOM queries
