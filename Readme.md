# Considerations:
JavaScript Object: A simple and flexible way to store key-value pairs of data.
Custom Class: A more structured approach to organizing data, providing encapsulation and methods for operations.
Data Storage: Deciding how to store habit data.
Scalability: Ensuring that the data structure can handle a growing number of habits.
Maintainability: Designing the data structure to be easy to understand and modify.

Callbacks and their use case


```javascript

    
    
    // Add event listeners to editable cells
    const editableCells = tableBody.querySelectorAll('[contenteditable="true"]');
    editableCells.forEach(cell => {
        cell.addEventListener('blur', handleCellEdit);
        cell.addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
            if (event.key === 'Enter') {
                event.preventDefault();
                this.blur();
            }
        });
    });
}

```
**Blur Event**

The blur event fires when an element loses focus
Used in our application for saving edits when users finish editing a cell
Example analogy: Think of it like finishing chopping vegetables - once you're done (blur), you move on to the next step

**Data Attributes**

Custom data attributes are used to store metadata about table cells:

data-index: Stores the row index
data-field: Identifies the field type (name or goal)

Think of data attributes like labels on storage boxes:

The box (element) contains the content
Labels (data attributes) tell us what's inside and where it belongs
Must start with "data-" but can be named anything after that
Cannot use dynamic values like ${habit.name} as attribute names

template literal syntax ${index} 

event.target refers to the specific element that triggered the element, so the cell.

custom data attributes can be anything as long as they start with data-

## Things I forgot about:
Accessing Input Value Too Early: 
I tried to log habitInput.value immediately on page load, before the user interacted with the form. 
Improvement: Always retrieve input values after user action (e.g., form submission or button click).

Missing Event Listener: 
I didnâ€™t have an event listener on the form to handle user input submission. 
Improvement: Use event listeners to capture form data and prevent default form behavior when needed.

Incorrect Button Attribute: 
The button tag had action="submit", which is not correct. 
Improvement: Use type="submit" for form submission buttons.

## Problems and Solutions 


**Problem: Inefficent Iterative Build / Cumulative Output
**
```javascript
for (count = 0; count <= habit_data.length; count ++) {
      let habit = habit_data[count]
      let row = `<tr>
                  <td>${habit.name} </td>
                  <td>${habit.goal} </td>
              </tr>`;
      tableBody.innerHTML += row;
  }
 
```
**Solution: So SIMPLE 
**

let newHabit = habit_data[habit_data.length - 1]; // Get the last added habit

```javascript
let newRow = `<tr>
                <td>${newHabit.name}</td>
                <td>${newHabit.goal}</td>
             </tr>`;

```
// Append the new row without duplicating previous ones
tableBody.innerHTML += newRow;
