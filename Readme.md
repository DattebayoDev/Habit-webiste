# Considerations:
JavaScript Object: A simple and flexible way to store key-value pairs of data.
Custom Class: A more structured approach to organizing data, providing encapsulation and methods for operations.
Data Storage: Deciding how to store habit data.
Scalability: Ensuring that the data structure can handle a growing number of habits.
Maintainability: Designing the data structure to be easy to understand and modify.

## New Information
Callbacks and their use case

## Things I forgot about:
Accessing Input Value Too Early: 
I tried to log habitInput.value immediately on page load, before the user interacted with the form. 
Improvement: Always retrieve input values after user action (e.g., form submission or button click).

Missing Event Listener: 
I didnâ€™t have an event listener on the form to handle user input submission. 
Improvement: Use event listeners to capture form data and prevent default form behavior when needed.

Incorrect Button Attribute: 
The button tag had action="submit", which is not correct. 
Improvement: Use type="submit" for form submission buttons.

## Problems and Solutions 
Currently, I am able to add habits, but there some overlapping when I try to display them. The habits display from the Object . 
I solved in myself; no help. I basically just created a count = 0. Then I created a loop using while which only ran if the length of my dict was greater than pointer or equal to my pointer, then i would add 1 to my pointer which would make it not run. So as long as my count is equal to dictionary, it will not run. I will probably run into issues later when i delete them. 



## Before and After Code 


Problem: Inefficent Iterative Build / Cumulative Output

```javascript
for (count = 0; count <= habit_data.length; count ++) {
      let habit = habit_data[count]
      let row = `<tr>
                  <td>${habit.name} </td>
                  <td>${habit.goal} </td>
              </tr>`;
      tableBody.innerHTML += row;
  }
 
```
Solution: So SIMPLE 

let newHabit = habit_data[habit_data.length - 1]; // Get the last added habit

```javascript
let newRow = `<tr>
                <td>${newHabit.name}</td>
                <td>${newHabit.goal}</td>
             </tr>`;

```
// Append the new row without duplicating previous ones
tableBody.innerHTML += newRow;
