# Things I forgot about:
Accessing Input Value Too Early: 
I tried to log habitInput.value immediately on page load, before the user interacted with the form. 
Improvement: Always retrieve input values after user action (e.g., form submission or button click).

Missing Event Listener: 
I didnâ€™t have an event listener on the form to handle user input submission. 
Improvement: Use event listeners to capture form data and prevent default form behavior when needed.

Incorrect Button Attribute: 
The button tag had action="submit", which is not correct. 
Improvement: Use type="submit" for form submission buttons.

## Review: 
Arrow functions


## Dumb Mistakes 
Incorrect assumption: 
I spent 2 hours, trying to figure out why my console was not logging my habit input's turns out I just needed to update the chrome browser. This made me feel very duumb. 
Correct: 
When using Chrome with certain extensions enabled, the form's onsubmit event handler fails to trigger, preventing the expected "asa" log from appearing. The issue is resolved in incognito mode, suggesting an extension conflict that interferes with form submission or JavaScript event handling.

## Current Issues

I am not able to display my habit data on the webpage.
